## General info
This challenge was to create different graphs and plots using both Pandas and Matlibplot. The data consisted of mice with tumors and the type of treatment they received. I needed to clean the data for "Mouse ID" and "Sex" while completing the project. It was also important to keep both the Pandas and Matplotlib graphs as close to identical as possible.

## Technologies
* Pandas
* Matplotlib.plot
* Jupyter Notebook
* Gitbash

## Information
Final repo can be found under: "pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb"
